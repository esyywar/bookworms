Practicing MERN stack with basic social media for book lovers.

# About

This is a simple full-stack project for me to practice MERN stack. It is a social media site where book lovers can create a profile, share posts, keep a library of favourite books, comment/like others' posts.

The app has been deployed using heroku at https://desolate-everglades-71533.herokuapp.com/

React bootstrap was used for a quick and dirty front-end as this was not the focus of the project. Node Express backend features password encryption, protected routes, several dynamic pages.
